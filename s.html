            <h3>Secure Text Transfer</h3>
            <p>Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.
			DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.
In public key cryptosystem, enciphering and deciphering are governed by distinct keys, E and D, such that computing D from E is computationally infeasible 
(e.g., requiring more than 10^100 instructions). The enciphering key E can thus be publicly disclosed without compromising the deciphering key D. 
This was the main ideology behind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol. Each user of the network can, therefore, place his enciphering key in a public directory.
 This enables any user of the system to send a message to any other user enciphered in such a way that only the intended receiver can decipher it.
 As such, a public key cryptosystem is a multiple access cipher. A private conversation can therefore be held between any two individuals regardless of whether they have ever communicated before.
 Each one sends messages to the other enciphered in the receiver’s public enciphering key and deciphers the messages he receives using his own secret deciphering key.</p>
